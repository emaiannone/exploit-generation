\textbf{This should be revamped with a restricted set of simple vulnerabiltites that does not trigger any problem with EvoSuite}

Suppose we want to generate exploits for the CVE-XXXX-xxxx, that is described by the triple
(\textit{\url{classFQN}},
\textit{\url{methodDescr}},
\textit{lineNum}) and suppose we have a CUT like this:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java, frame=single]
public class MyCUTXXXX {
    BODY
}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{To Be Continued}

The preliminary investigation shows promising results, despite the many constraints and simplifications we have imposed.
The next steps will be focus on solving the urgent problems highlighted by the artificial examples, though some
additional ones are still needed before going for a proper
\textbf{large scale empirical study} involving multiple real OSS projects that relies on a representative set of
vulnerabilities (in terms of complexity).

We are aware of the risks associated with \textsc{EvoSuite}; however, future implementations could be migrated to
other frameworks or reimplemented from ``scratch'' in order to overcome the aforementioned limitations
(primarily the one related to the code instrumentation).

# Reproduction steps
There are different ways to achieve the same results. Here is a simple set of steps to follow to reproduce the experiment from scratch:

1. Move into EvoSuite root directory: `cd exploit-generation` (this command may change depending on your CWD)
2. Generate all EvoSuite JARs: `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
3. Move into client projects root directory: `cd projects`
4. Compile and install dependencies of all client projects: `./build.sh`
5. Run the experiment script: `./experiment.sh`

The script will iterate through the 11 client projects, for each running SIEGE with 4 different search budgets.
Each SIEGE execution iterates on each CVE contained in *vulnerabilities.csv* (i.e., 11) and on each class contained in the current project.
All in all, we will have about `11 * 4 * 11 * 3` GA executions (some project may have fewer than 3 classes).

# How to interpret the exported CSV
If a CVE has FAIL status it means that it is either unreachable from all clients classed, or has reached timeouts.
If a CVE has at least one SUCCESS for one client class, then it means either it is unreachable from other classes, or they have reached timeouts.

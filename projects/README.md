# Reproduction steps
There are different ways to achieve the same results. Here is a simple set of steps to follow to reproduce the experiment from scratch:

1. Move into EvoSuite root directory: `cd exploit-generation` (this command may change depending on your CWD)
2. Generate all EvoSuite JARs: `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
3. Move into client projects root directory: `cd projects`
4. Compile all client projects: `./compiles.sh`
5. Run the experiment script: `./experiment.sh`

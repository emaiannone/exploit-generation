# Reproduction steps
There are different ways to achieve the same results. Here is a simple set of steps to follow to reproduce the experiment from scratch:

1. Move into client projects root directory: `cd projects`
2. Make sure all client projects are compiled. You can use `mvn compile` on each project directory.
3. Move into EvoSuite root directory: `cd exploit-generation`
4. Generate all EvoSuite JARs: `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
5. Run the experiment script: `./experiment.sh`

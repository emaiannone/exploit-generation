# Reproduction steps
There are different ways to achieve the same results. Here is a simple set of steps to follow to reproduce the experiment from scratch:

1. Move into EvoSuite root directory: `cd exploit-generation` (this command may change depending on your CWD)
2. Generate all EvoSuite JARs: `mvn clean package -DskipTests`
3. Move into client applications root directory: `cd client_applications`
4. Compile and install dependencies of all client applications: `./build.sh`
5. Run the experiment script: `./experiment.sh`

The script will run SIEGE on the 11 client applications.
Each execution iterates on each CVE contained in *vulnerabilities.csv* (here, 11) and on each class contained in the project (here, 1 per project).
All this is repeated 4 times per search budget.
All in all, running `./experiment.sh` causes `11 * 11 * 4` GA executions, requiring several minutes.

# How to interpret the exported CSV
The export file is in `siege_exports/<project>.csv`.

If a CVE is unreachable from all client classes, then it will be listed once with UNREACHABLE status.
If a CVE is reachable, then it will list the results of each valid client class with SUCCESS status.

Thus, UNREACHABLE means the impossibility to produce valid coverage goals, while SUCCESS implies a valid GA execution, though it does not guarantee a successful exploit.
